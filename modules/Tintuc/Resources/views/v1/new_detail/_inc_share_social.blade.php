I, too, steamed the entire head of cabbage first, added some garlic powder to the beef mixture (I used 1/8 tsp - perfect!), doubled the sauce (a must!), and baked at 350 (covered with foil) for an hour, instead of using the slow cooker.  The only things I would change include using 3/4 tsp. pepper (1 1/4 tsp. was too spicy), and increase the onion to 1/2 cup for more flavor (which I did, and it was great!).  I measured exactly 1/4 cup for each roll, and I ended up with 10 rolls.  If you are pressed for time, you can substitute 1 Tbl. dried minced onion for the fresh onion.  The second time I made this, I sprinkled some salt on the rolls before adding the sauce, and that helped give it more flavor.  One more note: be SURE and use VERY lean beef - you don't cook the meat before rolling it into the cabbage leaves, so there will be no way to drain off the fat.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I've been taught (by several Polish ancestors) to use half ground beef and half ground pork for tender, flavorful golumbki.  I cooked the rice in water with 2 beef bouillion cubes added to it. (don't add extra salt to the meat mixture though.) To the meat, I added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. The pepper may seem like a lot but makes this dish sing! (well, it made my family sing...)  I tripled this recipe with great success.  If you're going through the trouble of making golumbki, make enough to freeze another meal or for a family gathering.  THANK YOU for asking us to boil the cabbage leaves rather than freeze them.  (Tripling this took 2 heads of cabbage and made about 48 rolls.) It makes all the difference between tender edible cabbage leaves or rubbery ones to boil the cabbage leaves.  My family has always taken rinsed, squeezed out sour kraut to lay over the prepared cabbage rolls.  Pour the tomato sauce mixture over all this and top with (uncooked) bacon slices.  No, this is not for the faint of heart fat free consumers, but for the people who want traditional cabbbage rolls (golumbki) that they and their kids will gobble up and ask for more! One more thing, this dish freezes well, so made in large quantities is nothing to fear.",

I found a video on the internet with a different technique for the cabbage leaves and I'll never do it another way.  Get a very large pot of water and bring up to a small boil; as you're waiting for the water to boil core the cabbage head with a fairly wide margin at the top and take off the outer leaves that are dirty. Once the water is hot, place the cabbage head into the boiling water.  After about a minute or so, the outside leaves will start to separate from the head; approx every 45 seconds a leaf or two will separate.  As they separate remove them from the water into a pie tin or bowl.  This is fail proof and the leaves are the perfect softness to roll with ease.",
